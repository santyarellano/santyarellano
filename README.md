- 👋 Hi, my name is Santiago Arellano.
- 👀 I’m interested in game programming, but I usually work in mobile or web dev.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CMAKE and going through effective C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool ideas (not crypto currencies, copys of other services, etc. Something new!)
- 📫 How to reach me: you can write to me at ssamdev039@gmail.com
